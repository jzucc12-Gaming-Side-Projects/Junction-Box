<h2>Summary</h2>
Get pairs of connected particles to their respective charging stations as fast as possible. 
However, you will sometimes need to break and re-connect the particles to navigate through the twisting mazes of... THE JUNCTION BOX!

Junction box was a solo developed submission for the Game Maker's Toolkit 2021 Game Jam. The theme for the 48 hour jam was "Joined Together". 
Out of the 5,755 entries, I ranked #827 for Fun (top 15%) and #2,202 overall (top 40%). Art assets for this game were partially created by myself 
and obtained from Unity and other online sources. Music and SFX were obtained from online resources.

<h2>New Repository Update</h2>
<p>This project came from a previous repository that contained 3rd party assets. Most art, music, and sfx files have now been witheld from the repository for redistribution purposes as has the progression system.</p>
